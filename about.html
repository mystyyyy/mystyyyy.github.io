                Hello my name is Brandon H Nguyen, and I go by Mysty online! I’m a concept and illustration artist.
                <br><br>
                I was born in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania, and have always gravitated towards art. I always had the urge to create things, and with access to only a pencil and paper, art was an easy response to satiate the urge. I love doodling on my classwork and homework (my teachers were usually ok with this!), imagining scenes of badass warriors, mages, and rangers fighting each other with otherworldly powers. 
                <br><br>
                Growing up on the internet I played tons of flash games, was exposed to anime, and thought that World of Warcraft was the coolest thing ever. I was also exposed to video content from artists like Draw with Jazza, and importantly, Ross Tran. He made me realize that my love for art was more than just a fun little hobby. And thus, I was thrown into the concept art and illustration rabbit hole.
                <br><br>
                I was initially enrolled in a performing arts highschool as a vocalist (singing is fun!), but switched to visual art after freshman year to truly engross myself in art. I dug up all the resources I could find online so I can improve as fast as I can. 
                <br><br>
                I have always created art, and will do so until the day I die. It’s like breathing to me, and you can’t make me stop!
